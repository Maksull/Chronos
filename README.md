   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Set up your environment variables. 
   ### Configuration

Before running the application, you need to create a `.env` file in the chronos-backend root directory of the project and configure the following fields:

- **EMAIL_HOST**: The SMTP host for your email provider (Gmail in this case).
- **EMAIL_PORT**: The port to use for SMTP (587 is typically used for secure connections).
- **EMAIL_USER**: Your email address.
- **EMAIL_PASSWORD**: Your email app password (not your regular email password, but an app-specific password).
- **EMAIL_FROM**: The email address that will appear as the sender.
- **EMAIL_SECURE**: Set to `false` if you're using TLS, otherwise set to `true`.
- **APP_URL**: The base URL for your application.
- **APP_NAME**: The name of your application.

Make sure to replace placeholders like `your email` and `your email app password` with actual values.

4. Start the database (PostgreSQL) and ensure it's running.

5. To run both the frontend and backend of the application, please execute the following command in each of the respective repositories:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`. Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.
